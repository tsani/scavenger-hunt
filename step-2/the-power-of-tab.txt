The interactive prompt in which you type commands is called the _shell_.
There are many shells out there.

A very common one, which comes installed on almost all systems is _bash_.
However, you're not using bash. You're using a more advanced shell called
_zsh_ ("zee ess aitch" or "zee shell").
For example, the interactive highlighting that you see would not be possible in
bash.

One really cool feature of zsh that you'll be using a lot is _tab completion_.

Pressing TAB will cause the shell to try to complete the word you've started
typing.
Try typing `cd is` followed by TAB. It will complete to `cd isnt-that-awesome`.
You can try out other completions in this directory such as

    less the<TAB>
    les<TAB> the<TAB>

When you're done playing with tab completion, enter the `isnt-that-awesome`
directory.
