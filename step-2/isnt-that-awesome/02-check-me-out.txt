You might have noticed that the output of `pwd` differs slightly from what the
shell reports.

shell: ~/scavenger-hunt/step-2/isnt-that-awesome
pwd: /home/student/scavenger-hunt/step-2/isnt-that-awesome

That's because the shell has a special interpretation of the tilde (~)
character: it's essentially a shortcut built-in to the shell that refers to
what's called your _home directory_.

Your home directory is the directory your shell starts in when you log in. All
your personal files should be stored under there.

We can create new directories to keep things organized by using the `mkdir`
command, followed by the name of the directory we want to create.

For example, try `mkdir important-documents`.
By the way, it's perfectly normal for there to be no output after running this
command. In Linux, the philosophy for commands is to produce no output if they
worked.

Run `ls` to admire your work!
