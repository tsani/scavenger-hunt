So a new file, `cake-recipe.txt` has appeared in this directory.

Obviously, making cake is extremely important, so we should move it into the
important-documents directory. To move files, we use the `mv` command:

    mv SOURCE DEST

The DEST path can identify a directory, in which case the file will keep its
name but be moved to that directory, but the DEST path can alternatively
identify a *file*, in which case the SOURCE file will be both moved and
renamed!

In other words, moving a file and renaming it are conceptually the same thing.

Move the file `cake-recipe.txt` into `important-documents`.
Remember to use tab completion!

Then, enter the `important-documents` directory, and have a look around with
`ls`.
