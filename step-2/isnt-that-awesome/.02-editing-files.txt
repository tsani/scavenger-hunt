Now that we have a backup of our recipe, we can fix `cake-recipe.txt`.

To do so, we will use an advanced interactive text editor called neovim.

The first thing to know about neovim is that it uses a system of _modes_:
  - When neovim starts, you are in NORMAL mode.
    Oddly enough, you can't input text in normal mode!
    In normal mode, most keys serve to move you around.
    Here are some basic motion commands:
      - h j k l: these keys move the cursor left down up right respectively.
        It might seem very very odd that we move around using these keys
        instead of the more traditional arrow keys, but hjkl has the benefit of
        being on the _home row_ of the keyboard. This way, you rarely need to
        move your hands off the home row. The upshot? Faster typing!
      - C-u C-d: (the notation "C-x" means "Control-x")
        These commands move the cursor Up and Down a half page, just like `u`
        and `d` did in less.
        Coincidence? Not at all! Many programs in Linux have shortcuts modelled
        after the ones from the older editor vi, from which neovim is
        descended.
  - The most *useful* mode is INSERT mode.
    There are several ways to enter insert mode:
      - i: pressing the `i` key will put you in insert mode at the location of
        the cursor.
      - a: pressing the `a` key will put you in insert mode at the position
        *after* the cursor. This is essential for putting text on the end of a
        line.
      - A: pressing shift+a will put you in insert mode at the end of the
        current line.
  - When you're in normal mode, you can execute a *command*. In particular,
    this is how you can save and quit neovim!
    To enter command mode, press : (colon), and then input the command.
      - :w - save the current file.
      - :q - quit neovim. If the file has unsaved changes, this command won't
        work.
      - :q! - quit even if there are unsaved changes.
      - :wq - save and quit.

Remember that? No problem. There a reference card version in the file named
`blurb`.
Finally, open the file in neovim by running `nvim cake-recipe.txt`.
