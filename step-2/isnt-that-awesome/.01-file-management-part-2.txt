So now we're crazy deep: your present working directory is:

If you haven't had a look at the cake recipe, I encourage you to, because
there's something slightly amiss with it.

Okay so our cake recipe doesn't have any baking powder! How will we ever make a
cake like that!

First, let's make a backup of the recipe. A backup is nothing more than a copy,
and to copy files, we use the `cp` command. Its syntax is exactly the same as
mv's:

    cp SOURCE DEST

Try out `cp cake-recipe.txt bad-cake-recipe.txt`
