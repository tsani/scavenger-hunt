You now find yourself deep within a _directory tree_...

We call it a _tree_ because if you turn your head to the right and squint
really hard, then the following diagram looks like a (very lopsided) tree.

    .
    ├── 01 open up the instructions with "cat step-1"
    ├── step-1
    └── step-2
        ├── 01 have a look at "the-power-of-tab.txt"
        ├── isnt-that-awesome
        │   └── check-me-out.txt
        └── the-power-of-tab.txt

The directory you're presently working in is called the "present working
directory" or "current working directory".
There is a command to tell you what the present working directory is: `pwd`.
Give it a try!

Check out "02-check-me-out.txt".
