What good is an empty directory? Not much.
Let's create some important documents!

To create an empty file (very important), we can use the `touch` command.
Try out:

    touch important-documents/world-domination-plans.txt

Remember, you can use TAB to complete the rather long `important-documents`
directory name!

Next, view `04-paths-and-files.txt`.
