In the last command you ran, you wrote what's called a _path_. Paths have two
kinds of components:

    /----------------- PATH ---------------------\
    important-documents/world-domination-plans.txt
    \--------|--------/ \---------|--------------/
             |                    +-- file name
             +-- directory name

Slashes separate the components of a path.

There are two kinds of paths:
  * _absolute_ paths, which begin with a slash.
  * _relative_ paths, which do not.

A relative path is interpreted *relative to* the present working directory.
So when you wrote

    touch important-documents/world-domination-plans.txt

that's the same thing as writing

    touch /home/student/scavenger-hunt/step-2/isnt-that-awesome/important-documents/world-domination-plans.txt

since `/home/student/scavenger-hunt/step-2/isnt-that-awesome` is your present
working directory.

Whew! That's a long long path!

Remember that the shell will convert a leading tilde into the path to your home
directory, so another way of writing that absolute path would be

    ~/scavenger-hunt/step-2/isnt-that-awesome/important-documents/world-domination-plans.txt

which is slightly shorter.
