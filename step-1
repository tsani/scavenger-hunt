Welcome to the scavenger hunt!

By exploring the files in here, you'll learn basic Linux commands.

You just used the `cat` command, which prints out the entire contents of a
file. For very long files, this isn't so great, so try `less step-1` to open
this file in an interactive viewer called `less`. To quit it, press `q`.

When you're done, move on to step 2 by entering the step-2 directory using
`cd step-2`.
A good habit to get into upon entering a new directory is to see what's inside,
by using `ls`.

Remember:
  * `ls` stands for LiSt
  * `cd` stands for Change Directory.

Fun fact:
  * `less` is based on an older program called `more`, which got its name
    because it lets you see _more_ things on your screen!
    Remember: less is more!
